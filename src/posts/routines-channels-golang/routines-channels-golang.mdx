  Today we'll be going over how we can take Golang's synchonous nature and turn
  it asynchronous by splitting its main routine into child routines, and making
  use of the channels that get exposed from within.
</PageQuoteText>

<WhatIsRoutine />

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "net/http"
)
func main() {
links := []string{
"https://www.google.com"
"https://www.twitter.com"
"https://www.youtube.com"
}
for _, link := range links {
checkLinks(link)
}
}
func checkLinks(link string) {
_, err := http.get(link)
if err != nil {
fmt.Printf("%s might be down!\n", link)
return
}

fmt.Printf("%s is online\n", link)

}

```

What's happening here is that when Go loops through the slice of links and inevitably executes the http request for the link, the main routine that gets created goes to sleep and waits until it gets a response. Then it keeps continuing until there aren't any links left, resulting in:

```bash

https://www.google.com is online!
https://www.twitter.com is online!
https://www.youtube.com is online!

```

As you can see, no matter how many times we run the program like this, it will _always_ be completely synchronous.

<HowToMakeRoutine />

```go

package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "net/http"
)

func main() {
  links := []string{
    "https://www.google.com"
    "https://www.twitter.com"
    "https://www.youtube.com"
  }

  for _, link := range links {
    // add the go keyword before the function is invoked
    // and that's it!
    go checkLinks(link)
  }
}

func checkLinks(link string) {
  _, err := http.get(link)

  if err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("%s might be down!\n", link)
    return
  }

  fmt.Printf("%s is online\n", link)
}

```

But there's a problem, because when we run the program, nothing happens. This is because when the main routine creates every child routine, it looks through the rest of the `main` function and sees if there's anything left to do. Now in this particular case there isn't, so it just exits before the child routines can finish.

<AllowingCommunication />

```go

package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "net/http"
)

func main() {
  links := []string{
    "https://www.google.com"
    "https://www.twitter.com"
    "https://www.youtube.com"
  }

  // initalize the channel and set its type
  // this tells the channel what type to use for communication
  c := make(chan string)

  for _, link := range links {

    // pass the channel in the function so it has access
    go checkLinks(link, c)
  }

  for i := 0; i < len(links); i++ {

    // print whatever gets passed in the channel for each link
    fmt.Println(<-c)
  }
}

// add the channel as an argument
func checkLinks(link string, c chan string) {
  _, err := http.get(link)

  if err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("%s might be down!\n", link)

    // pass the value into the channel
    c <- "Might be down I think"
    return
  }

  fmt.Printf("%s is online\n", link)
  c <- "Yup its up"
}

```

Now when we execute this program:

```bash

https://www.twitter.com is online!
Yup its up

https://www.youtube.com is online!
Yup its up

https://www.google.com is online!
Yup its up

```
