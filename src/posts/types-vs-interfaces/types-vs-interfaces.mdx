<PageQuoteText>
  The line that defines when you should be using a TypeScript type or an
  interface is one that often gets blurred. Let's go over the differences
  between the two and when you should be using one over the other.
</PageQuoteText>

<WhatAreDifferences />

<DifferenceHeader>1. Classes cannot implement types</DifferenceHeader>

```typescript
class Point {
  x: number
  y: number
}
interface Shape {
  area: () => number
}
type Perimeter = {
  perimeter: () => number
}
// this shape can either be of type Shape and Point
// or Perimeter and Point
type RectangleShape = (Shape | Perimeter) & Point
class Rectangle implements RectangleShape {
  x = 2
  y = 3

  area() {
    return this.x + this.y
  }
}
```

The code here is invalid and doesn't work, because **classes can only implement another class or an interface**. Which makes sense since a class is a blueprint afterall and therefore it can't inherit one or another's shape structure.

However it does make sense to union **Shape** and **Perimeter** on just a regular object:

```typescript

const rectangle: RectangleShape {
  x: 12,
  y: 33,
  area() => {
    return 2 * (rectangle.x + rectangle.y)
  },
  perimeter() => {
    return rectangle.x + rectangle.y
  }
}

```

In this example, the rectangle object **must** contain a method on it that matches the **area** or **perimeter** signature. If not, TypeScript will complain about the lack thereof.

<DifferenceHeader>2. Extending interfaces with types</DifferenceHeader>

Similarly to classes, you can't extend an interface with a type alias if you're using the union operator within your type definition. Just like a class, an interface is a static blueprint, and can't exist in one or another's shape.

```typescript
type ShapeOrPerimeter = Shape | Perimeter

// Ts error: An interface may only extend a class or another interface
interface RectangleShape extends ShapeOrPerimeter, Point {}
```

<DifferenceHeader>3. Declaration merging with types</DifferenceHeader>

While merging declarations may work with interfaces, this is not the case for types. If you're unfamiliar with declaration merging, essentially it's where you define the interface multiple times, and the duplicates merge into one.

```typescript
interface Box {
  height: number
  width: number
}

interface Box {
  scale: number
}

const box: Box = { height: 5, width: 6, scale: 10 }
```

This doesn't work with type aliases, as a type is a unique entity for both global, and module scope; This is also the only use case in which you should definitely be using interfaces.

Declaration merging via interfaces is very important for when we are writing 3rd party type definitions for libraries that are not authored with TypeScript. That way the user has the option to extend them if need be.

<DifferenceHeader>So, what should I be using for React?</DifferenceHeader>

In general, it doesn't really matter, just be consistent. Personally, I prefer interfaces over types most of the time until I **need** to create a type specifically. This occurs the most when you need to merge declarations coming from types or interfaces into a single type.

For example:

```typescript

interface OwnProps = {...};
interface StoreProps = {...};

type Props = OwnProps & StoreProps;

```
